- **Rate Limiting**: Granular protection against abuse

## Architectural Refactoring

### 1. Application Factory Pattern

Implemented factory pattern for better configuration management and testing:

```python
# Before: Monolithic app.py
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update(...)

# After: Scalable factory pattern
def create_app(config_name=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    config_class = get_config()
    app.config.from_object(config_class)
    register_extensions(app)
    return app
```

**Benefits:**
- Environment-specific configurations
- Better testing capabilities
- Easier deployment automation
- Reduced configuration drift

### 2. Service Layer Architecture

Introduced service layer to separate business logic from routes:

```python
# Before: Logic in routes
@app.route('/contact', methods=['POST'])
def contact():
    # Direct database operations
    contact = Contact(...)
    db.session.add(contact)
    db.session.commit()

# After: Service layer
@main_bp.route('/contact', methods=['POST'])
def contact():
    contact, error = DatabaseService.create_contact(data)
    if error:
        flash(error, 'error')
```

**Benefits:**
- Reusable business logic
- Better error handling
- Easier unit testing
- Consistent data validation

### 3. Multi-Level Caching Strategy

Implemented hierarchical caching for optimal performance:

**Level 1: Application Cache (5 minutes)**
- Frequently accessed data
- API responses
- User sessions

**Level 2: Redis Cache (30 minutes)**
- Database query results
- Computed values
- Cross-request data

**Level 3: Database Query Cache (1 hour)**
- Complex aggregations
- Report data
- Static content

**Level 4: CDN Edge Cache (24 hours)**
- Static assets
- Images and documents
- Compressed resources

### 4. Database Optimization

Enhanced database performance through multiple strategies:

**Connection Pooling:**
```python
SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
    'pool_recycle': 3600,
    'pool_pre_ping': True,
    'pool_timeout': 30,
    'max_overflow': 50,
    'pool_size': 20
}
```

**Strategic Indexing:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_contact_created_at ON contact(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_process_consultation_process_number ON process_consultation(process_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_message_session_id ON chat_message(session_id);
```

**Query Optimization:**
- Eliminated N+1 queries
- Implemented eager loading
- Added query result caching
- Database-level pagination

## Rate Limiting Implementation

### Endpoint-Specific Limits
```python
@limiter.limit("100 per minute")  # General pages
@limiter.limit("30 per minute")   # Chatbot API
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")   # Contact forms
@limiter.limit("20 per minute")   # Process consultation
```

### Benefits:
- Protection against DDoS attacks
- Fair resource allocation
- Improved system stability
- Better user experience for legitimate users

## Error Monitoring and Alerting

### Error Classification
- **Critical**: System failures requiring immediate attention
- **High**: Performance degradation affecting users
- **Medium**: Elevated error rates
- **Low**: Minor issues for investigation

### Monitoring Metrics
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### Alert Thresholds
```python
ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    'response_time_p95': 2.0,  # seconds
    'error_rate': 5.0,         # percentage
    'memory_usage': 85.0,      # percentage
    'cpu_usage': 80.0,         # percentage
    'cache_hit_rate': 70.0     # percentage
}
```

## Security Enhancements

### CSRF Protection
Implemented comprehensive CSRF protection across all forms:
```python
WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True
WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = 3600
```

### Input Sanitization
Enhanced input validation and sanitization:
```python
def sanitize_input(input_string):
    # HTML entity encoding
    # SQL injection prevention
    # XSS protection
    # Length validation
```

### Session Security
Improved session management:
```python
