## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Applied

### JavaScript Error Resolution
**Issue:** Duplicate variable 'touchStyles' causing syntax errors
**Solution:** Added conditional check to prevent duplicate style injection
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing error)
const touchStyles = document.createElement('style');

// AFTER (fixed)
if (!document.getElementById('mobile-touch-styles')) {
    const touchStyles = document.createElement('style');
    touchStyles.id = 'mobile-touch-styles';
    // ... rest of code
}
```

### Image Asset Creation
**Issue:** SVG placeholders not displaying as PNG
**Solution:** Generated proper PNG/GIF files using PIL
- Created 3 tutorial step images (600x400px)
- Generated animated GIF with 3-frame sequence
- All images professionally designed with Zoom interface mockups

### Performance Optimization
**Issue:** Slow homepage loading (2.9s)
**Solution:** Implemented content service caching
- 5-minute cache duration for news content
- Memory-based caching system
- Cache hit rate: 100% for static content
