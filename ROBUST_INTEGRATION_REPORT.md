    status = ServiceStatus.HEALTHY
    failure_count = 0
```

# Exponential backoff pattern
@RetryManager.with_retry(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=1.5)
def robust_operation():
    # Protected operation with automatic retry
    pass
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation
```python
# Fallback response when OpenAI unavailable
try:
    response = chatbot_service.get_response(message)
except Exception:
    response = "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again."
```
