### API Configuration (Production Optimized)
```python
# Deployment-optimized settings
model="gpt-4o"                 # Latest OpenAI model
max_tokens=150                 # Efficient token usage
temperature=0.6                # Balanced creativity/consistency
timeout=20                     # Production-optimized timeout
stream=False                   # Deployment compatibility
```
